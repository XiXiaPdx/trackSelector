#### By **Xi Xia**

## Description

This is form-based project that determines which course at Epicodus you should take based on your answers to the 10 questions.  

Some questions directly and only affect your "preference score" for one single course.  Other questions affect multiple preference scores.  Your one answer to these questions will produce different scoring effects. While one score may increase by, say 1, another score affected by that question may only increase by 0.5.  

This repo includes index.html, CSS, JS, and IMG folders.
